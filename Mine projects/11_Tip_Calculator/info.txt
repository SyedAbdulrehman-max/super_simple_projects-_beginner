There are **two ways** this can work in your project, depending on what you want:

1. **User puts tip separately**

   * The program asks: "Enter bill amount" → user types 1000
   * Then asks: "Enter tip percentage" → user types 10
   * Program calculates → tip = 100, total = 1100

2. **Cut tip from total bill**

   * The program asks: "Enter total money you have" → user types 1000
   * Then asks: "Enter tip percentage" → user types 10
   * Program calculates → tip = 100, remaining = 900 (bill after giving tip)

So it depends:

* **If you want to *add* tip → user puts tip separately.**
* **If you want to *deduct* tip → you cut from the total bill.**

percentage=( mark / total Marks) * 100
percentage = ( 40 / 100 ) * 100

percentage to number

number= ( percentage / 100 ) * total number
