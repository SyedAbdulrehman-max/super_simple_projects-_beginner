🔹 What is the game?

The computer will pick a random number (for example, between 1 and 100).

The player has to guess the number.

The computer gives hints like:

“Too high” (if guess is bigger than the number)

“Too low” (if guess is smaller than the number)

The game ends when the player guesses correctly.
