# What the task wants (in plain words)

* Ask the user for **weight** and **height**.
* Use the **BMI formula** to calculate their Body Mass Index.
* Show the **BMI number** and (usually) a **category** like “Underweight”, “Normal”, “Overweight”, etc.

# The math you need

**BMI = weight\_kg / (height\_m)^2**

* Weight must be in **kilograms (kg)**
* Height must be in **meters (m)**
  (If the user gives centimeters, you must convert: `height_m = cm / 100`)

# What to build (thinking in Python)

* A **function** (for example, `calculate_bmi(weight, height)`) that:

  1. **Validates** inputs (no zeros or negatives).
  2. **Calculates** BMI using the formula.
  3. **Returns** the BMI value (you can round to 1–2 decimals).

* Optionally another small function (or logic) to **classify** the BMI:

  * Underweight: `< 18.5`
  * Normal: `18.5–24.9`
  * Overweight: `25–29.9`
  * Obesity: `>= 30`

# Example (step-by-step math)

Suppose:

* weight = **70 kg**
* height = **1.75 m**

Compute:

* height² = 1.75 × 1.75 = **3.0625**
* BMI = 70 ÷ 3.0625 = **22.86…** → about **22.9** (Normal)

# Inputs/Outputs you should handle

**Inputs** (from user):

* Weight (kg)
* Height (m)
  (If they enter cm, convert to m: `m = cm / 100`.)

**Outputs** (to user):

* The BMI number (rounded).
* The category (optional but common).

# Common beginner mistakes to avoid

* ❌ Using **centimeters directly** in the formula (must convert to meters).
* ❌ Using **integer division** by mistake (in Python 3 `/` is fine).
* ❌ Not checking for **0 or negative** values (height cannot be 0).
* ❌ Mixing **lbs/feet** with **kg/m** (keep units consistent).
  If you must accept imperial units:

  * kg = lbs × 0.453592
  * m = inches × 0.0254 (or m = feet × 0.3048)

# A simple plan you can follow

1. Get weight (kg) and height (m) from the user.
2. Validate: both must be positive.
3. Compute BMI using the formula.
4. Round the result (e.g., 1–2 decimals).
5. Print BMI and (optionally) the category.

If you want, I can turn this into a tiny, clean Python function and a short example interaction next.
