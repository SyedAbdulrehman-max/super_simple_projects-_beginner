### Question:

**Quiz App – Load and take a multiple-choice quiz – (Dicts, lists, logic)**

---

### Explanation as a Python program (step by step, no solution code):

1. **Storing Questions (Dicts and Lists)**

   * We need some questions with options and answers.
   * In Python, we can store this data using **lists** (to keep multiple questions) and **dictionaries** (to describe each question).
   * Example idea:

     ```python
     {
       "question": "What is the capital of Pakistan?",
       "options": ["Lahore", "Islamabad", "Karachi", "Multan"],
       "answer": "Islamabad"
     }
     ```
   * A **list of such dictionaries** can hold the entire quiz.

2. **Asking Questions (Loops)**

   * We go through each question one by one using a **loop**.
   * For every question, display the text and all its options.

3. **Taking Input (Logic with User Choice)**

   * The user types the option number or text.
   * Compare the user’s answer with the correct answer stored in the dictionary.
   * If it matches → give points.
   * If not → mark it wrong.

4. **Scoring System**

   * Start with score = 0.
   * Every time the user answers correctly, increase the score.
   * At the end, show the total score.

5. **Logic Summary**

   * Use **lists** → hold all the questions.
   * Use **dicts** → define each question with options and answer.
   * Use **loops** → ask all questions.
   * Use **if/else logic** → check answers and update score.
