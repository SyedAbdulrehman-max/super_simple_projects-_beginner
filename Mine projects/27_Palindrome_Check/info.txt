Palindrome Checker	Check if a string is a palindrome	Strings, logic

### ðŸ“Œ Palindrome Checker (Project Info)

A **palindrome** is a word, number, or phrase that reads the same forward and backward.
Examples: `madam`, `121`, `racecar`.

In this project, the program:

1. Takes a word or sentence as input.

2. Reverses the string.

3. Compares the original and reversed strings.

4. If both are the same â†’ itâ€™s a palindrome.

5. Otherwise â†’ itâ€™s not a palindrome.

This project helps practice **strings, logic, and conditions** in programming.
